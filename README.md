# okolokucno skakutalo source code
 Source code of my old first person "speedrunning" game, i wont be needing this anymore since i am remaking everything from scratch

 Made with Unity 2021.3.15f1

 This was my first "big" unity project so there are a lot of small/beginner mistakes.

 The movement was based arround the character controller from danidev's video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAC8U9-dTZU ) and its slightly modified to have wallrunning and minor bug fixed.

 Im putting this spaghetti code here for educational purposes just in case anyone wants to take a look at it.
